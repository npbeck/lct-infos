## Tips for finding a home in San Sebastián
- The best website to look for places is [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com/).
- Be careful to check if the price already includes the bills (Internet, water etc.) or not.
- Whichever source or website you use, *find the owner's phone number and contact them immediately via WhatsApp*. If you don't yet use WhatsApp, you *need* to download and start using it to survive in Spain. Don't send a message through the website and wait for a response, don't send an email, message them on WhatsApp. Especially in summer before the academic year starts, decent places for rent don't stay available for more than a few days. Owners will have hordes of students visiting.
- Student residences offer a lot of perks, but the University of the Basque Country doesn't have any, isn't partners with any, and they're super expensive in San Sebastián. The cheapest will be around 600€ per month for a shared room and that one still has waiting lines since several months before. Residences also prioritize students who stay the whole academic year (September to June), so if you still want to try that option, keep that in mind.
- The university has a database ([OSTATU]()) where owners (not associated with the university) can put up announcements for rooms or places for rent. Any upcoming student can create an account and get access to it for two months (I don't know why it's limited either), and there are good options. Be careful, however, as it takes a while for the database to update when places are no longer available, so don't count on everything there really being free when you see it.
