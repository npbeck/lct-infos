## Tips for finding a home in San Sebastián
- The best website to look for places is [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com/). You can also try [SwiftFlats](https://www.swiftflats.com/), [Badi](https://badi.com/), [Fotocasa](https://www.fotocasa.es/es/) or [Pisocompartido](https://www.pisocompartido.com/). 
- There are also a couple of Facebook groups, which are specifically targeted at internationals searching for housing in San Sebastián. To give you an example, take [this group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/120894155502986) (posts in Spanish) or [this one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/flats.sansebastian/) (posts in English, targeted at Erasmus students).
- Be careful to check if the price already includes the bills (Internet, water etc.) or not.
- Whichever source or website you use, *find the owner's phone number and contact them immediately via WhatsApp*. If you don't yet use WhatsApp, you *need* to download and start using it to survive in Spain. Don't send a message through the website and wait for a response, don't send an email, message them on WhatsApp if you find the number. Especially in summer before the academic year starts, decent places for rent don't stay available for more than a few days. Owners will have hordes of students visiting.
- Student residences offer a lot of perks, but the University of the Basque Country doesn't have any, isn't partners with any, and they're super expensive in San Sebastián. The cheapest will be around 600€ per month for a shared room and that one still has waiting lines since several months before. Residences also prioritize students who stay the whole academic year (September to June), so if you still want to try that option, keep that in mind.
- The university has a database ([OSTATU](https://www.ehu.eus/ostatu/pisos/index.html)) where owners (not associated with the university) can put up announcements for rooms or places for rent. Any upcoming student can create an account and get access to it for two months (I don't know why it's limited either), and there are good options. Be careful, however, as it takes a while for the database to update when places are no longer available, so don't count on everything there really being free when you see it.
- Owners usually ask for a deposit equivalent to 1 month of rent.

## Empadronamiento
Whichever way you decide, make sure you know whether you need to have *empadronamiento*, i.e., to have your residence registered with municipality. This requires your landlord to comply. However, plenty of landlords are actually renting appartments off the books, without paying taxes, and will not help you to get *empadronamiento*. If you are not a EU citizen you have to keep this in mind when looking for appartments, because your visa will require you to provide *empadronamiento*.
