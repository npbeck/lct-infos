## Tips for finding a home in San Sebastián
- The best website to look for places is [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com/). You can also try [SwiftFlats](https://www.swiftflats.com/), [Badi](https://badi.com/), [Fotocasa](https://www.fotocasa.es/es/) or [Pisocompartido](https://www.pisocompartido.com/). 
- There are also a couple of Facebook groups, which are specifically targeted at internationals searching for housing in San Sebastián. To give you an example, take [this group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/120894155502986) (posts in Spanish) or [this one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/flats.sansebastian/) (posts in English, targeted at Erasmus students).
- Be careful to check if the price already includes the bills (Internet, water etc.) or not. If not, they will most likely be an extra 30-60 euros a month, varying between winter and summer.
- **Very important**: Whichever source or website you use, *find the owner's phone number and contact them immediately via WhatsApp*. If you don't yet use WhatsApp, you *need* to download and start using it to survive in Spain. Don't send a message through the website and wait for a response, don't send an email, message them on WhatsApp if you find the number. Facebook Messenger also works if you found it there. Especially in summer before the academic year starts, decent places for rent don't stay available for more than a few days, and owners are most likely to respond via WhatsApp or calls.
- Student residences offer a lot of perks, but the University of the Basque Country doesn't have any, isn't partners with any, and they're super expensive in San Sebastián. The cheapest (RESA) will be around 600€ per month for a shared room, and it has waiting lines since several months before. Residences also prioritize Y1 bachelors students (because they have more time here) so for masters students it's more difficult to get a spot.
- The university has a database ([OSTATU](https://www.ehu.eus/ostatu/pisos/index.html)) where owners (not associated with the university) can put up announcements for rooms or places for rent. Any upcoming student can create an account and get access to it for two months (I don't know why it's limited either), and there are good options. Be careful, however, as it takes a while for the database to update when places are no longer available, so don't count on everything there really being free when you see it.
- Owners usually ask for a deposit equivalent to 1 month of rent.
- Everyone probably knows this by now but **please be careful of housing scams**. There are just so many and you really cannot trust anyone, even through rental agencies. It is hugely recommended that you arrive in the city and meet the landlord and visit the apartment before paying anything.

## Neighborhoods
- **Amara**: Residential neighborhood south of the center where rent tends to be cheaper than the Center or Gros. Calm and peaceful, but a little farther from the faculty (~4km) and there's not much to do.
- **Antiguo**: The neighborhood where the faculty is. Also a residential neighborhood; it's calm and rent is cheaper as well as groceries and services. There's not much to do here either, but there's more than other residential neighborhoods thanks to the uni campus and the nightlife around it.
- **Centro**: The name says it all. Conveniently close to pretty much everything (Parte Vieja, La Concha beach, the bus and train stations etc), okay to walk to uni (~3km) and with plenty of bus options. Buildings are bigger and slightly newer than in Parte Vieja. Downside is, of course, it's probably the most expensive. It can also get quite noisy depending on the street.
- - **Egia** and **Intxaurrondo**: Residential neighborhoods across the river from the center, also have cheaper rent but the downside is they're full of hills so some streets can be quite steep.
- **Gros**: The most popular neighborhood among young people in the city, and in terms of rent it's as expensive or more than in the Center, but tends to be cheaper for groceries and services and also considerably calmer (less touristy). Known for Zurriola beach, where all the cool people and the surfers hang out. A little farther from the faculty as it is on the other side of the river (~4km), but well connected by bus.
- **Parte Vieja**: The most touristy area of the city, which almost entirely consists of bars and restaurants, so it can get quite noisy especially in nicer weather months. Great location in terms of walkability and transportation, and especially entertainment. Close to pretty much everything except the faculty (3.5km) though lots of people walk there anyway. Also has a big offer of flats but buildings can be very old so make sure to check the infrastructure well.

## Empadronamiento
Whichever way you decide, make sure you know whether you need to have *empadronamiento*, i.e., to have your residence registered with municipality. This requires your landlord to comply. However, plenty of landlords are actually renting appartments off the books, without paying taxes, and will not help you to get *empadronamiento*. If you are not a EU citizen you have to keep this in mind when looking for appartments, because your visa might require you to provide *empadronamiento*.
