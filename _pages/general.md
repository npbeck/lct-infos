## General life tips

### Money
- If you were awarded the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship for LCT, **please** be aware that you will only receive the first payment in the end of September, including the travel allowance, the installation costs and the monthly allowance for September. After that, the monthly allowance for each month is transferred at the end of the previous month.
- You will only start receiving the payments once you are in Spain and send them your bank details. You also do not receive the monthly payment for September if you don't arrive before the month ends.
- Most of all establishments accept debit cards as payment for any amount of money. It's of course important to carry cash for emergencies, but don't worry too much about having lots of it, and instead get your card on Apple/Google Pay and you can mostly just use your phone.

### Language
- Life can be quite difficult in San Sebastián if you speak zero Spanish. The Basque Country is a bilingual region, and most of the locals speak Spanish and Basque, and while it is quite a busy turistic city in the region, that just means more people speak Spanish than Basque. Enough people working in commerce and services speak English that you can survive just fine, and most of them try to be helpful when possible, but it might not be a very pleasant experience. As early as you can, I would highly recommend starting Spanish lessons or self-study.
- The University of the Basque Country offers an [intensive Spanish course](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/nazioarteko-harremanak/en-intensive-spanish-august-september) in August-September, and regular [Spanish](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/nazioarteko-harremanak/en-autumn-spring-spanish-courses) and [Basque](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/nazioarteko-harremanak/en-autumn-spring-basque-courses) courses throughout both semesters. The credits you get from those do not count towards LCT credits, but they're good options if you want to learn the language. They're also not free for masters students, but you can email them proof that you're an Erasmus student and that gets you 50% off the fee.

### Commerce and services
- Most establishments in the city close during the afternoon for "siesta", a break between the morning-early afternoon and the late afternoon/night shifts. The closing time usually ranges from 1-4pm and they reopen usually around 6-8pm, sometimes as late as 8:30 or 9pm for restaurants and bars (especially in summer), but each place has different times. To make things even harder, this break might also vary throughout the year as the day gets shorter and rainier. Google Maps usually has the correct opening-closing times but not even they can keep up.

- Almost everything closes on sundays. A few supermarkets such as SuperCor and ToroToro and the small Eroski Rapids will open, and some small, local commerce might also open on sundays and close instead on mondays, but as a rule of thumb, don't wait to do your shopping then.

- Eroski and Lidl are the cheapest supermarket chains around, and both have store-brand stuff that is always the cheapest and good quality.

- Chinese bazars are the most important stores in the city. They have absolutely everything you might need for very specific reasons such as kitchenware, cheap towels and rags, luggage, stationery, organizers, and thousands of other things. You can find them on Google Maps by searching for "bazar", as most of them are named something like "Bazar Oriental" and "Bazar Chino". Most of them are in Gros but also spread around every neighborhood.

- Many touristy things only work during summer and close or finish their working season around October 1st and only come back around springtime or early summer, so if you get the chance to be here in summertime, don't forget to enjoy these things while you can:
  - Hourly boat trips to/from Isla Santa Clara.
  - Kayak and Stand-Up Paddle rentals from Ondarreta to Isla Santa Clara.
  - Polboriña, an outdoor bar in Mount Urgull that holds concerts around 5pm to 8:30pm (sunset), but only if the weather is good.

- Almost any bar/restaurant/café will let you go in and use their bathroom even if you aren't a client. If it's full you can walk in and find your way, or you can politely ask any server and they'll show you.

### Weather
- Get an umbrella, the lightest and most portable you possibly can, and bring it everywhere always.

### Travel

- As traveling by bus tends to be the cheapest, [Alsa](https://www.alsa.com/) is the main Spanish company. Signing up for Alsa Plus costs nothing and gives you some discounts and points every time you book a ticket. Besides, ESN provides a discount code (currently `ESN22`) that anyone can use (for 1 ticket at a time) and it gives you some discount and allows you to change or cancel your ticket free of charge.
- The other most popular bus companies operating here are [FlixBus](https://global.flixbus.com/) and [BlaBlaBus](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/bus).
- For train trips you would look at [Renfe](https://www.renfe.com/es/en), though Spain infamously does not have the fastest trains. For some scenarios it's worth it but do check carefully against your bus options. It also offers small discounts if you sign up (free of charge) for [Más Renfe / Renfe+](https://www.renfe.com/es/en/viajar/tarjeta-mas-renfe/what-is-it).
- [Ryanair](https://www.ryanair.com/pt/pt) does not operate in the San Sebastián or Bilbao airports but they do in Vitoria-Gasteiz (1h away), Santander (2h30min away) and Biarritz (<1h away). [Volotea](https://www.volotea.com/pt/), another low-cost airline, operates from San Sebastián, Bilbao and Santander with a few flights inside Spain and to Portugal. [Vueling](https://www.vueling.com/es) is one of Spain's national airlines and operates in all these airports but is not always very cheap.
  - Signing up for an ESN card gives you [some Ryanair benefits](https://www.esncard.org/ryanair), such as free carry-on luggage on flight routes that allow it (not all routes).
- Lots of people here travel via Bordeaux because it has a bigger airport with more international flights. There are lots of buses to-from Bordeaux with durations varying from 3h30min to 6+ hours. Be mindful to take into account that these bus trips might suffer delays due to passport checks at the border, and that the Bordeaux airport and the bus/train station Saint Jean are an hour apart (by city bus).
