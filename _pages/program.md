## Managing Expectations about the local master's program in San Sebastián 
Although you are an LCT student, your study experience will be defined for the most part by the two local programs you are assigned to, not so much by any central LCT regulations. And among the consortium, programs vary a lot.
This is why on this page we list some information about the local program in San Sebastián, so you know what to expect and prepare for.

- the program size is about **30 students**.
  - about 5 students will be from the [LCT program](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/master/master-language-communication-technologies/syllabus), the remaining students are studying in the local [HAP/LAP master's program](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/master/master-language-analysis-processing/syllabus).
- the program is **not consecutive**, meaning it does not built on a bachelor's program. Rather, it is a standalone program, starting more or less from scratch.
- the classes are exactly those that are listed in the syllaba linked to above. Unfortunately, students are not allowed to take classes or receive credits from classes outside of the syllabus.
- the program is **targeted both at students with a background in computer science and students with a background in linguistics**.
  - in previous years, the student body was divided roughly half and half between the two backgrounds.
  - of course, this means that the **technical aspects of the classes will be very light on computer science students**.
- the program is designed as a **three-semester program**, with two semesters of classes and one semester for your thesis.
  - first year LCT students will thus take the first two semesters of classes and then move on.
  - second year LCT students unfortunately have to take 30 Credits from that same pool of classes and write their thesis.

Hopefully, this list of details can help you manage your expectations and/or consider whether the program is suited for you.
