## Tips regarding transportation around San Sebastián and outside

### Bus
- All buses in San Sebastián have credit card machines so you can pay the ticket by approximation, which is great for when you arrive and for emergencies, but is also the most expensive ticket of all (full fare, always).
- If you get the personalized Mugi card, the ticket fare is much lower and you also get discounts the more trips you've taken. You can order it [online](https://www.mugi.eus/index.php/en/cards/types-of-card) and have it delivered.
- If you're under 25 you can also get the Mugi youth card which gives you even more discount.
- The Mugi card also works on Euskotren, the local trains, and the fare will also be much cheaper than if you buy a ticket at the station.
- Mugi cards can be charged at ATM's in any Kutxabank. Just place it on the spot for approximation cards, follow the steps, and use your debit card in the machine to pay for the credit.
- Bus times on Google Maps are usually correct, but be careful, especially if you're counting on the last bus. The timetables change between summer and the rest of the year, and other apps might have outdated information. If it's critical to you, it's best to check the actual DBUS or Lurraldebus app/website.
