## How to handle Spanish Bureaucracy
Spain has a very bureaucratic and poorly digitized administration. We have spend days struggling with it and hope to save you a considerable amount of time with the following tips.

---

## EU citizens - things to consider
EU citizens that live in Spain for more than three months must request a *número de identidad de extranjeros (NIE)*, i.e. an identification number for foreigners. Technically, you will need to be registered as a resident at the *ayuntamiento* for this ("*empadronamiento*"), but if you follow the procedure we outline below, the authorities will usually not ask for proof of this. However, if you have a rental contract, registering and having *empadronamiento* will only make things easier. 

## Non-EU citizens - things to consider
For non-EU citizens, it will depend on your home country and your visa situation. For example, if you're from Brazil or India you have to get a student visa to come, which will have your NIE, but the visa itself is only valid for 90 days and then you need to get the TIE once you're here. And in order to get the TIE, first you need to be *empadronado(a)*, registered with the municipal *ayuntamiento*.

---

## Registering with the *ayuntamiento*
Registration (*empadronamiento*) is usually a quick and beneficial procedure. You get access to many municipal services, including discounts in public transport.
However, you will need to present a contract or an affirmative letter from your landlord, which many landlords who are renting off the books are not willing to provide. Nonetheless, it is **essential for non-EU citizens to register**, so keep this in mind when looking for apartments.

Make your appointment for registration [here](https://www.donostia.eus/info/udalinfo/Tramites.nsf/vTramites/8A56560AE3CA7957C125814500390C56?OpenDocument&idioma=cas&des=Ciudadan%EDa&id=D580485#) (name of the procedure: *Padrón Municipal de Habitantes: alta*). Then follow the instructions, i.e., bring a registration form along with your document that proves you live in San Sebastián to the municipality office.

### The NIE
The NIE is the Identification Number for Foreigners, a number of identification that you can obtain via the process below once you're here, or that might be provided to you if you get a visa in your home country to be allowed into Spain.

The NIE is particularly important if you want to work in Spain, for instance in order to get your LCT internship credits. Spanish employers will always ask you for a NIE and a Spanish social security number, which you can only request with an NIE.

Follow these steps to request a NIE
1. Request an appointment [here](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/pagina/index/directorio/icpplus/language/es_ES). The form will ask you for a province - select "Gipuzkoa". It will then ask you for the name of the procedure - select "policía - certificados y asignación NIE" It will then ask you for your personal details. Register here with your passport. After that, select the option "Solicitar cita" to make an appointment. You will have to enter more personal information and will finally get to select a time and place that suits you. There are two offices that you can go to: The national police in Donostia-San Sebastián, and the national police in Irún. The latter is about a 40-minute bus ride from San Sebastián, but often has more available appointments. If there are no appointments at all, you can try to just go without one. This worked for some people, but there is of course no guarantee that it will work for you.
2. You will now have to get all the necessary paperwork and copies together. You should get an email that tells you which exactly are needed. Those documents include a form called [EX-15](https://sede.policia.gob.es/portalCiudadano/extranjeria/EX15.pdf), which is the primary request form. 
3. You will also have to pay an administrative fee, which is a tedious process. Set some time aside for taking care of it. You will need to fill out the form [Tasa 790 - Código 012](https://sede.policia.gob.es/Tasa790_012/ImpresoRellenar) online. Instructions for how to fill it out will hopefully also get to you with the confirmation email from your appointment. Print this form out after having filled it.
5. Now take the form to a bank - not to the police - to pay the administrative fee. You need to do this before the appointment and keep the proof of payment. Unfortunately, lots of bank will only receive their own clients' forms, so you might have to go from door to door and see who will receive you. From our experience BBVA has always received this payment, so looking for a BBVA is your easiest option, and when you do go there, try the ATM inside the agency, not the one on the street. But as all of the other banks, they have strange schedules. Definitely go there in the morning. Also keep in mind that the fee **can only be paid in cash**, with bills (not coins!), and the ATM at BBVA will only give you change up to 10€ (fully in coins).
6. Lastly, will all your documents, copies and confirmations, go to your appointment with the police and pray for the best :) They typically don't ask many questions and you should be in and out within half an hour.
7. Congratulations! You hopefully now have your NIE. You should get a print-out of the number. However, be patient with the digital propagation of the number. It might take various days until Spain's digital systems actually recognize your NIE as valid.

### The social security number
If you want to sign a work contract in Spain, you will be asked for a social security number. You need to provide you NIE, along with some other personal data to request it. Usually, proof of residence (*empadronamiento*) is not checked.

Follow these steps to request a social security number:

You might want to check out [this info page](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/InformacionUtil/44539/44084?changeLanguage=en) about requesting a social security number. There are basically two ways of doing it. You can either [request it via internet](https://sp.seg-social.es/ProsaInternet/OnlineAccess?ARQ.SPM.ACTION=LOGIN&ARQ.SPM.APPTYPE=SERVICE&ARQ.IDAPP=XV204100&PAUC.FORCE_IDP=IPCE&_ga=2.103625671.63756880.1636477911-2140256611.1635967704) (which requires authentication with a [*certificado digital*](https://www.sede.fnmt.gob.es/certificados/persona-fisica/obtener-certificado-software/solicitar-certificado), a digital access token, which you can generate if you have a NIE. This will entail one more visit to an office). 

Or you fill out the [TA1 form](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10817/31190/572), [make an appointment](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/) and get the social security number at an office.

### The TIE

The TIE is the Identification Card for Foreigners. As opposed to just the NIE number, this is an actual ID that acts as proof of your permission to stay in Spain. If your visa isn't valid for the entire duration of your time here, for example, you need the TIE or you will be considered illegal after your visa expires.

The process is also slightly more annoying, but you've already gone through the worst of it with the visa.

1. Request an appointment [here](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/pagina/index/directorio/icpplus/language/es_ES). The form will ask you for a province - select "Gipuzkoa". When it asks you for the name of the procedure, it is "*Policía-Toma de Huellas (Expedición de Tarjeta) y Renovación de Tarjeta de Larga Duración*". (*Tarjeta de larga duración* (long-stay card) usually refers to the TIE.)
2. The website then provides you a list of all the documents you need, as I will sum up here:
* [TIE request form](https://extranjeros.inclusion.gob.es/ficheros/Modelos_solicitudes/mod_solicitudes2/17-Formulario_TIE.pdf), filled and signed
* Your passport and copies of the main page and the visa
* Proof of payment of the fee
* A recent ID/passport-size picture (they will scan it and give it back to you)
* Certificate of *empadronamiento* and a copy
3. You then have to pay the administrative fee, by filling out [Tasa 790 - Código 012](https://sede.policia.gob.es/Tasa790_012/ImpresoRellenar), printing it and bringing it to a bank. Read [this step](#feeprocess) for more details on the convoluted process of paying this tax.
4. With all that, you just go to your appointment, give them your documents and your signature that will be on the card, and it will be ready in around 40-45 days, then you will have to book another appointment and go pick it up :)


## Paying fees (*tasas*)
For most of the bureaucratic processes you will be asked to pay a so-called tasa - usually one on the form 790-012. In this section we want to give you more details about this payment, which **can be very annoying** if you don't know them.
- as a foreigner forget about paying the *tasa* online. Slice it as you want, it's not going to work; neither if your Spanish friend does it nor if you have a Spanish bank account.
- you **need to physically go to a bank**. Unfortunately, most banks only let their own customers pay the *tasa* and won't accept your payment. We highly recommend to **go to BBVA**, which to our knowledge is the only bank that reliably accept foreigner's payments in cash. There are two options:
  - You can **make the payment with BBVA personnel** at the counter. This might be easiest if you do not have a NIE yet, or are unsure about the payment process. Bring a suitable sum in cash and do not ask for much change. Be sure to bring your ID document. There is a serious downside, though: Service hours are very weird, usually only in the mornings and sometimes not even every working day of the week. On weekends and holidays, there is no such service.
  - You can **make the payment at a BBVA ATM**. Make sure you use a large ATM that accepts cash and is able to print bank statements. This option is obviously much more comfortable, because in the larger BBVA offices you can do it at any time of the day and don't need the personnel there.
    1. Insert your card (doesn't have to be a BBVA card)
    2. choose the option of paying bills/*tasas*
    3. scan the barcode of your payment (can be on your phone)
    4. enter your details (amount to be payed, NIE, name, lastname)
    5. confirm and insert cash bills that cover the sum (make sure you don't need much change)
    6. print the receipt or have the ATM send it to your email address
