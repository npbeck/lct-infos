## How to handle Spanish Bureaucracy
Spain has a very bureaucratic and poorly digitized administration. We have spend days struggling with it and hope to save you a considerable amount of time with the following tips.

## EU citizens - things to consider
EU citizens that live in Spain for more than three months must request a *número de identidad de extranjeros (NIE)*, i.e. an identification number for foreigners. Technically, you will need to be registered as a resident at the *ayuntamiento* for this ("*empadronamiento*"), but if you follow the procedure we outline below, the authorities will usually not ask for proof of this. However, if you have a rental contract, registering and having *empadronamiento* will only make things easier.

## Registering with the *ayuntamiento*
Registration (*empadronamiento*) is usually a quick and beneficial procedure. You get access to many municipal services, including discounts in public transport.
However, you will need to present a contract or an affirmative letter from your landlord, which many landlords who are renting off the books are not willing to provide. Nonetheless, it is **essential for non-EU citizens to register**, so keep this in mind when looking for appartments.

Make your appointment for registration [here](https://www.donostia.eus/info/udalinfo/Tramites.nsf/vTramites/8A56560AE3CA7957C125814500390C56?OpenDocument&idioma=cas&des=Ciudadan%EDa&id=D580485#) (name of the procedure: *Padrón Municipal de Habitantes: alta*). Then follow the instructions, i.e., bring a registration form along with your document that proves you live in San Sebastián to the municipality office.

### The NIE
The NIE is particularly important if you want to work in Spain, for instance in order to get your LCT internship credits. Spanish employers will always ask you for a NIE and a Spanish social security number, which you can only request with an NIE.

Follow these steps to request a NIE
1. Request an appointment [here](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/pagina/index/directorio/icpplus/language/es_ES). The form will ask you for a province - select "Gipuzkoa". It will then ask you for the name of the procedure - select "policía - certificados y asignación NIE" It will then ask you for your personal details. Register here with your passport. After that, select the option "Solicitar cita" to make an appointment. You will have to enter more personal information and will finally get to select a time and place that suits you. There are two offices that you can go to: The national police in Donostia-San Sebastián, and the national police in Irún. The latter is about a 40-minute bus ride from San Sebastián, but often has more available appointments. If there are no appointments at all, you can try to just go without one. This worked for some people, but there is of course no guarantee that it will work for you.

2. You will now have to get all the necessary paperwork and copies together. You should get an email that tells you which exactly are needed. Those documents include a form called [EX-15](https://sede.policia.gob.es/portalCiudadano/extranjeria/EX15.pdf), which is the primary request form. 
3. You will also have to pay an administrative fee, which is a tedious process. Set some time aside for taking care of it. You will need to fill out the form [Tasa 790 - Código 012](https://sede.policia.gob.es/Tasa790_012/ImpresoRellenar) online. Instructions for how to fill it out will hopefully also get to you with the confirmation email from your appointment. Print this form out after having filled it. 
4. Now take the form to a bank - not to the police - to pay the administrative fee. You need to do this before the appointment. Unfortunately, lots of bank will only receive their own clients' forms, so you might have to go from door to door and see who will receive you. From our experience BBVA has always reived this payment. But as all of the other banks, they have strange schedules. Definitely go there in the morning.
5. Lastly, will all your documents, copies and confirmations, go to your appointment with the police and pray for the best :) They typically don't ask many questions and you should be in and out within half an hour.
6. Congratulations! You hopefully now have your NIE. You should get a print-out of the number. However, be patient with the digital propagation of the number. It might take various days until Spain's digital systems actually recognize your NIE as valid.

### The social security number
If you want to sign a work contract in Spain, you will be asked for a social security number. You need to provide you NIE, along with some other personal data to request it. Usually, proof of residence (*empadronamiento*) is not checked.

Follow these steps to request a social security number
1. You might want to check out [this info page](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/InformacionUtil/44539/44084?changeLanguage=en) about requesting a social security number. There are basically two ways of doing it. You can either [request it via internet](https://sp.seg-social.es/ProsaInternet/OnlineAccess?ARQ.SPM.ACTION=LOGIN&ARQ.SPM.APPTYPE=SERVICE&ARQ.IDAPP=XV204100&PAUC.FORCE_IDP=IPCE&_ga=2.103625671.63756880.1636477911-2140256611.1635967704) (which requires authentication with a [*certificado digital*](https://www.sede.fnmt.gob.es/certificados/persona-fisica/obtener-certificado-software/solicitar-certificado), a digital access token, which you can generate if you have a NIE. This will entail one more visit to an office). Or you fill out the [TA1 form](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10817/31190/572), [make an appointment](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/) and get the social security number at an office.
