    <h2 id="tips-for-organizing-you-lct-internship">Tips for organizing you LCT internship</h2>
<p>As you might know, the LCT curriculum includes a mandatory internship, which you can recognize at either one of the universities you were placed at. 
Since the local curriculum at University of the Basque country is rather limited, year one students might find it particularly appealing to get additional credits by means of an internship.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-credits-can-you-get">How many credits can you get?</h3>
<p>Each university has its own rules for how an internship is recognized. In San Sebastián, the internship module is worth <strong>10 ECTS</strong>, equivalent to <strong>250 hours of work</strong> (part time or full time doesn’t matter).</p>

<h3 id="specific-rules-to-be-aware-of">Specific rules to be aware of</h3>
<p>The rules for what counts as an internship are rather lax. Any work in the area of Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics will probably count if you present it in a convincing manner.
You will need a formal work agreement, but any typical internship that applies to your field of studies will probably be accepted.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-organizing-the-internship">Who is organizing the internship?</h3>
<p>You are! Do not expect much guidance or recommendations from the administration. It is essentially up to you to find an institution, company, research lab etc. that will host you as an intern.
So do not wait on any move from the university. If you want your internship to count towards your credits in San Sebastián, we recommend that you have a contract ready-to-go by new year’s.</p>

<h3 id="finding-institutions">Finding institutions</h3>
<p>So which place is best suited for you to do an internship? We can hardly make good recommendations for you personally, but here are a couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is virtually no NLP industry presence in San Sebastián. You might find some openings in Bilbao, which is about an hour drive away and the largest technology hub in the Basque Country. Other than that, you might want to consider hybrid or remote options.</li>
  <li>With regard to Spain, Barcelona probably offers the most job opportunities, followed by Madrid</li>
  <li>There are a couple of research centers in San Sebastián that work in directions which match the LCT program. For instance:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://ixa.ehu.eus">IXA group</a> which largely organizes the local LCT master. Also, check out the <a href="http://www.hitz.eus">HiTZ center for language technology</a>, which represents both the IXA and the <a href="https://aholab.ehu.eus/aholab/">aholab group</a>.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.bcbl.eu/en/research">Basque Center on Brain, Cognition &amp; Language</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.vicomtech.org/en/vicomtech/internal-structure?area=6">VICOMTECH</a>, a center for applied research, which has a group on Speech and Natural Language Technologies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For a more general overview of scientific research in the Basque Country, check out <a href="https://www.science.eus/en">this overview page</a> by Ikerbasque, the Basque Foundation for Science</li>
  <li>also, keep in mind that salary levels in Spain are considerable lower than in most northern European countries. This will hold especially for public research, where an internship can also easily be unpaid.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="recognizing-you-internship">Recognizing you internship</h3>
<p>Once you have an promising opportunity, make sure to raise the matter of recognizing your internship early enough with your employer. They might want to know about your internship requirements, which is <strong>considered obligatory</strong> if you want to receive credits for it.
In addition to the contract you sign with your employer, the University of the Basque Country also needs you to facilitate an agreement between the University and the employer. Talk to the local LCT coordinator about this.</p>

<p>Typically, the agreement will consist of</p>
<ul>
  <li>some information about your work
    <ul>
      <li>what will you we working on?</li>
      <li>what technologies and tools will you use?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>contact information from your employer</li>
  <li>contact information and personal details from your supervisor (e.g., boss, research group leader etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have to act as the mediator between the university and the hosting institution and make sure, the university receives the agreement document in time, and then approves it.</p>

<h3 id="registering-your-internship-at-university">Registering your internship at university</h3>
<p>Once you have completed your internship, it can be graded and registered in the university’s academic management system G.A.U.R.
The <strong>grade for your internship</strong> is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70%: assessment by your internship instructor/advisor. The local coordinators will take care of this part</li>
  <li>30%: assessment of the student report by the local coordinator</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon finishing the internship you thus <strong>need to write a student report</strong> following a template that the local coordinators provide you with. This student report has a mostly self-reflective tone, yet the instructions you are given are somewhat ambiguous and imprecise. The questions that you need to answer move along the lines of the prompts below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Describe the tasks and work carried out as well as that of the departments to which you have been assigned.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Assess the tasks you developed, considering the knowledge and skills acquired. In how far do these tasks relate to your university studies?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“List the problems you encountered, and describe the procedures you followed to solve them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Outline in how far the internship contributed to your learning process.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evaluation your internship and make suggestions for improvement.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once your internship instructor/advisor’s assessment is handed in and your own report is assessed, your internship can be registered with a grade in G.A.U.R.</p>
