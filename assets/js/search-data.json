If you were awarded the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship for LCT, please be aware that you will only receive the first payment in the end of September, including the travel allowance, the installation costs and the monthly allowance for September. After that, the monthly allowance for each month is transferred at the end of the previous month. | You will only start receiving the payments once you are in Spain and send them your bank details. You also do not receive the monthly payment for September if you don’t arrive before the month ends. | Most of all establishments accept debit cards as payment for any amount of money. It’s of course important to carry cash for emergencies, but don’t worry too much about having lots of it, and instead get your card on Apple/Google Pay and you can mostly just use your phone. | . Language . Life can be quite difficult in San Sebastián if you speak zero Spanish. The Basque Country is a bilingual region, and most of the locals speak Spanish and Basque, and while it is quite a busy turistic city in the region, that just means more people speak Spanish than Basque. Enough people working in commerce and services speak English that you can survive just fine, and most of them try to be helpful when possible, but it might not be a very pleasant experience. As early as you can, I would highly recommend starting Spanish lessons or self-study. | The University of the Basque Country offers an intensive Spanish course in August-September, and regular Spanish and Basque courses throughout both semesters of the year. The credits you get from those do not count towards LCT credits, but they’re good options if you want to learn the language. They’re also not free for masters students, but you can email them proof that you’re an Erasmus student and that gets you 50% off the fee. | . Commerce and services . Almost any bar/restaurant/café will let you go in and use their bathroom even if you aren’t a client. If it’s full you can walk in and find your way, or you can politely ask any server and they’ll show you. . | Most establishments in the city close during the afternoon for “siesta”, a break between the morning-early afternoon and the late afternoon/night shifts. The closing time usually ranges from 1-4pm and they reopen usually around 6-8pm, sometimes as late as 8:30 or 9pm for restaurants and bars (especially in summer), but each place has different times. To make things even harder, this break might also vary throughout the year as the day gets shorter and rainier. Google Maps usually has the correct opening-closing times but not even they can keep up. . | Almost everything closes on sundays. A few supermarkets such as SuperCor and ToroToro and the small Eroski Rapids will open, and some small, local commerce might also open on sundays and close instead on mondays, but as a rule of thumb, don’t wait to do your shopping then. . | Eroski and Lidl are the cheapest supermarket chains around, and Eroski has store-brand stuff that is always the cheapest and good quality. . | Chinese bazars are the most important stores in the city. They have absolutely everything you might need for very specific reasons such as kitchenware, cheap towels and rags, luggage, stationery, organizers, and thousands of other things. You can find them on Google Maps by searching for “bazar”, as most of them are named something like “Bazar Oriental” and “Bazar Chino”. Most of them are in Gros but also spread around every neighborhood. . | Many touristy things only work during summer and close or finish their working season around October 1st, so if you get the chance to be here in summertime, don’t forget to enjoy these things while you can: . Hourly boat trips to/from Isla Santa Clara. | Kayak and Stand-Up Paddle rentals from Ondarreta to Isla Santa Clara. | Polboriña, an outdoor bar in Mount Urgull that holds concerts around 5pm to 8:30pm (sunset), but only if the weather is good. | . | .

You can also try SwiftFlats, Badi, Fotocasa or Pisocompartido. | There are also a couple of Facebook groups, which are specifically targeted at internationals searching for housing in San Sebastián. To give you an example, take this group (posts in Spanish) or this one (posts in English, targeted at Erasmus students). | Be careful to check if the price already includes the bills (Internet, water etc.) or not. | Whichever source or website you use, find the owner’s phone number and contact them immediately via WhatsApp. If you don’t yet use WhatsApp, you need to download and start using it to survive in Spain. Don’t send a message through the website and wait for a response, don’t send an email, message them on WhatsApp if you find the number. Especially in summer before the academic year starts, decent places for rent don’t stay available for more than a few days. Owners will have hordes of students visiting. | Student residences offer a lot of perks, but the University of the Basque Country doesn’t have any, isn’t partners with any, and they’re super expensive in San Sebastián. The cheapest will be around 600€ per month for a shared room and that one still has waiting lines since several months before. Residences also prioritize students who stay the whole academic year (September to June), so if you still want to try that option, keep that in mind. | The university has a database (OSTATU) where owners (not associated with the university) can put up announcements for rooms or places for rent. Any upcoming student can create an account and get access to it for two months (I don’t know why it’s limited either), and there are good options. Be careful, however, as it takes a while for the database to update when places are no longer available, so don’t count on everything there really being free when you see it. | Owners usually ask for a deposit equivalent to 1 month of rent. | . Empadronamiento . Whichever way you decide, make sure you know whether you need to have empadronamiento, i.e., to have your residence registered with municipality. This requires your landlord to comply. However, plenty of landlords are actually renting appartments off the books, without paying taxes, and will not help you to get empadronamiento. If you are not a EU citizen you have to keep this in mind when looking for appartments, because your visa will require you to provide empadronamiento. .",

          "content": "Tips for organizing you LCT internship . As you might know, the LCT curriculum includes a mandatory internship, which you can recognize at either one of the universities you were placed at. Since the local curriculum at University of the Basque country is rather limited, year one students might find it particularly appealing to get additional credits by means of an internship. . How many credits can you get? . Each university has its own rules for how an internship is recognized. In San Sebastián, the internship module is worth 10 ECTS, equivalent to 250 hours of work (part time or full time doesn’t matter). . Specific rules to be aware of . The rules for what counts as an internship are rather lax. Any work in the area of Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics will probably count if you present it in a convincing manner. You will need a formal work agreement, but any typical internship that applies to your field of studies will probably be accepted. . Who is organizing the internship? . You are! Do not expect much guidance or recommendations from the administration. It is essentially up to you to find an institution, company, research lab etc. that will host you as an intern. So do not wait on any move from the university. If you want your internship to count towards your credits in San Sebastián, we recommend that you have a contract ready-to-go by new year’s. . Finding institutions . So which place is best suited for you to do an internship? We can hardly make good recommendations for you personally, but here are a couple of things to keep in mind: . There is virtually no NLP industry presence in San Sebastián. You might find some openings in Bilbao, which is about an hour drive away and the largest technology hub in the Basque Country. Other than that, you might want to consider hybrid or remote options. | With regard to Spain, Barcelona probably offers the most job opportunities, followed by Madrid | There are a couple of research centers in San Sebastián that work in directions which match the LCT program. For instance: The IXA group which largely organizes the local LCT master. Also, check out the HiTZ center for language technology, which represents both the IXA and the aholab group. | The Basque Center on Brain, Cognition &amp; Language | VICOMTECH, a center for applied research, which has a group on Speech and Natural Language Technologies | . | For a more general overview of scientific research in the Basque Country, check out this overview page by Ikerbasque, the Basque Foundation for Science | also, keep in mind that salary levels in Spain are considerable lower than in most northern European countries. This will hold especially for public research, where an internship can also easily be unpaid. | . Recognizing you internship . Once you have an promising opportunity, make sure to raise the matter of recognizing your internship early enough with your employer. They might want to know about your internship requirements, which is considered obligatory if you want to receive credits for it. In addition to the contract you sign with your employer, the University of the Basque Country also needs you to facilitate an agreement between the University and the employer. Talk to the local LCT coordinator about this. . Typically, the agreement will consist of . some information about your work what will you we working on? | what technologies and tools will you use? | . | contact information from your employer | contact information and personal details from your supervisor (e.g., boss, research group leader etc.) | . You will have to act as the mediator between the university and the hosting institution and make sure, the university receives the agreement document in time, and then approves it. . Registering your internship at university . Once you have completed your internship, it is be graded and registered in the academic management system G.A.U.R. The grade for your internship is calculated as follows: . 70%: assessment by your internship instructor/advisor. The local coordinators will take care of this part | 30%: assessment of the student report by the university tutor | . Upon finishing the internship you thus need to write a student report following a template that the local coordinators provide you with. This student report has a mostly self-reflective tone, yet the instructions you are given are somewhat ambiguous and imprecise. The questions that you need to answer move along the lines of the prompts below. . “Describe the tasks and work carried out as well as that of the departments to which you have been assigned.” . “Assess the tasks you developed, considering the knowledge and skills acquired. In how far do these tasks relate to your university studies?” . “List the problems you encountered, and describe the procedures you followed to solve them.” . “Outline in how far the internship contributed to your learning process.” . “Evaluation your internship and make suggestions for improvement.” . Once your internship instructor/advisor’s assessment is handed in and your own report is assessed, your internship can be registered with a grade in G.A.U.R. .",

          "content": "How to handle Spanish Bureaucracy . Spain has a very bureaucratic and poorly digitized administration. We have spend days struggling with it and hope to save you a considerable amount of time with the following tips. . . EU citizens - things to consider . EU citizens that live in Spain for more than three months must request a número de identidad de extranjeros (NIE), i.e. an identification number for foreigners. Technically, you will need to be registered as a resident at the ayuntamiento for this (“empadronamiento”), but if you follow the procedure we outline below, the authorities will usually not ask for proof of this. However, if you have a rental contract, registering and having empadronamiento will only make things easier. . Non-EU citizens - things to consider . For non-EU citizens, it will depend on your home country and your visa situation. For example, if you’re from Brazil or India you have to get a student visa to come, which will have your NIE, but the visa itself is only valid for 90 days and then you need to get the TIE once you’re here. And in order to get the TIE, first you need to be empadronado(a), registered with the municipal ayuntamiento. . . Registering with the ayuntamiento . Registration (empadronamiento) is usually a quick and beneficial procedure. You get access to many municipal services, including discounts in public transport. However, you will need to present a contract or an affirmative letter from your landlord, which many landlords who are renting off the books are not willing to provide. Nonetheless, it is essential for non-EU citizens to register, so keep this in mind when looking for apartments. . Make your appointment for registration here (name of the procedure: Padrón Municipal de Habitantes: alta). Then follow the instructions, i.e., bring a registration form along with your document that proves you live in San Sebastián to the municipality office. . The NIE . The NIE is the Identification Number for Foreigners, a number of identification that you can obtain via the process below once you’re here, or that might be provided to you if you get a visa in your home country to be allowed into Spain. . The NIE is particularly important if you want to work in Spain, for instance in order to get your LCT internship credits. Spanish employers will always ask you for a NIE and a Spanish social security number, which you can only request with an NIE. . Follow these steps to request a NIE . Request an appointment here. The form will ask you for a province - select “Gipuzkoa”. It will then ask you for the name of the procedure - select “policía - certificados y asignación NIE” It will then ask you for your personal details. Register here with your passport. After that, select the option “Solicitar cita” to make an appointment. You will have to enter more personal information and will finally get to select a time and place that suits you. There are two offices that you can go to: The national police in Donostia-San Sebastián, and the national police in Irún. The latter is about a 40-minute bus ride from San Sebastián, but often has more available appointments. If there are no appointments at all, you can try to just go without one. This worked for some people, but there is of course no guarantee that it will work for you. | You will now have to get all the necessary paperwork and copies together. You should get an email that tells you which exactly are needed. Those documents include a form called EX-15, which is the primary request form. | You will also have to pay an administrative fee, which is a tedious process. Set some time aside for taking care of it. You will need to fill out the form Tasa 790 - Código 012 online. Instructions for how to fill it out will hopefully also get to you with the confirmation email from your appointment. Print this form out after having filled it. | Now take the form to a bank - not to the police - to pay the administrative fee. You need to do this before the appointment and keep the proof of payment. Unfortunately, lots of bank will only receive their own clients’ forms, so you might have to go from door to door and see who will receive you. From our experience BBVA has always received this payment, so looking for a BBVA is your easiest option, and when you do go there, try the ATM inside the agency, not the one on the street. But as all of the other banks, they have strange schedules. Definitely go there in the morning. Also keep in mind that the fee can only be paid in cash, with bills (not coins!), and the ATM at BBVA will only give you change up to 10€ (fully in coins). | Lastly, will all your documents, copies and confirmations, go to your appointment with the police and pray for the best :) They typically don’t ask many questions and you should be in and out within half an hour. | Congratulations! You hopefully now have your NIE. You should get a print-out of the number. However, be patient with the digital propagation of the number. It might take various days until Spain’s digital systems actually recognize your NIE as valid. | The social security number . If you want to sign a work contract in Spain, you will be asked for a social security number. You need to provide you NIE, along with some other personal data to request it. Usually, proof of residence (empadronamiento) is not checked. . Follow these steps to request a social security number: . You might want to check out this info page about requesting a social security number. There are basically two ways of doing it. You can either request it via internet (which requires authentication with a certificado digital, a digital access token, which you can generate if you have a NIE. This will entail one more visit to an office). . Or you fill out the TA1 form, make an appointment and get the social security number at an office. . The TIE . The TIE is the Identification Card for Foreigners. As opposed to just the NIE number, this is an actual ID that acts as proof of your permission to stay in Spain. If your visa isn’t valid for the entire duration of your time here, for example, you need the TIE or you will be considered illegal after your visa expires. . The process is also slightly more annoying, but you’ve already gone through the worst of it with the visa. . Request an appointment here. The form will ask you for a province - select “Gipuzkoa”. When it asks you for the name of the procedure, it is “Policía-Toma de Huellas (Expedición de Tarjeta) y Renovación de Tarjeta de Larga Duración”. (Tarjeta de larga duración (long-stay card) usually refers to the TIE.) | The website then provides you a list of all the documents you need, as I will sum up here: TIE request form, filled and signed | Your passport and copies of the main page and the visa | Proof of payment of the fee | A recent ID/passport-size picture (they will scan it and give it back to you) | Certificate of empadronamiento and a copy | . | You then have to pay the administrative fee, by filling out Tasa 790 - Código 012, printing it and bringing it to a bank. Read this step for more details on the convoluted process of paying this tax. | With all that, you just go to your appointment, give them your documents and your signature that will be on the card, and it will be ready in around 40-45 days, then you will have to book another appointment and go pick it up :) | Paying fees (tasas) . For most of the bureaucratic processes you will be asked to pay a so-called tasa - usually one on the form 790-012. In this section we want to give you more details about this payment, which can be very annoying if you don’t know them. . as a foreigner forget about paying the tasa online. Slice it as you want, it’s not going to work; neither if your Spanish friend does it nor if you have a Spanish bank account. | you need to physically go to a bank. Unfortunately, most banks only let their own customers pay the tasa and won’t accept your payment. We highly recommend to go to BBVA, which to our knowledge is the only bank that reliably accept foreigner’s payments in cash. There are two options: You can make the payment with BBVA personnel at the counter. This might be easiest if you do not have a NIE yet, or are unsure about the payment process. Bring a suitable sum in cash and do not ask for much change. Be sure to bring your ID document. There is a serious downside, though: Service hours are very weird, usually only in the mornings and sometimes not even every working day of the week. On weekends and holidays, there is no such service. | You can make the payment at a BBVA ATM. Make sure you use a large ATM that accepts cash and is able to print bank statements. This option is obviously much more comfortable, because in the larger BBVA offices you can do it at any time of the day and don’t need the personnel there. Insert your card (doesn’t have to be a BBVA card) | choose the option of paying bills/tasas | scan the barcode of your payment (can be on your phone) | enter your details (amount to be payed, NIE, name, lastname) | confirm and insert cash bills that cover the sum (make sure you don’t need much change) | print the receipt or have the ATM send it to your email address | | . | .",

All buses in San Sebastián have credit card machines so you can pay the ticket by approximation, which is great for when you arrive and for emergencies, but is also the most expensive ticket of all (full fare, always). | If you get the personalized Mugi card, the ticket fare is much lower and you also get discounts the more trips you’ve taken. You can order it online and have it delivered. | If you’re under 25 you can also get the Mugi youth card which gives you even more discount. | The Mugi card also works on Euskotren, the local trains, and the fare will also be much cheaper than if you buy a ticket at the station. | Mugi cards can be charged at ATM’s in any Kutxabank. Just place it on the spot for approximation cards, follow the steps, and use your debit card in the machine to pay for the credit. | Bus times on Google Maps are usually correct, but be careful, especially if you’re counting on the last bus.
