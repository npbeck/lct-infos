# Welcome // Bienvenid@ // Ongi etorri

to the unofficial info page for students of the [LCT master's program](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/master/master-language-communication-technologies) at University of the Basque Country! Since students come and go every year, transferring knowledge about how to best get settled in Donostia-San Sebasti√°n can be hard. This web site is one intent from previous students to make life easier for incoming students.
